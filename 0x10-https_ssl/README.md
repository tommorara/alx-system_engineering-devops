## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and understanding HTTPS and SSL within a web infrastructure. The primary goal is to secure website traffic, exploring the roles of HTTPS and SSL in modern web security, and implementing SSL termination.

## Background Context
Unsecured website traffic can lead to data theft, identity theft, and loss of user trust. This project addresses these issues by implementing HTTPS SSL to encrypt and secure web traffic, ensuring data integrity and security from the client to the server.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, learners should be able to explain the following without assistance:
- The two main roles of HTTPS SSL:
  - Encryption of communication to prevent eavesdropping
  - Authentication to prevent identity theft
- The importance of encrypting traffic:
  - Protecting data integrity
  - Securing personal and sensitive information
- What SSL termination means and how it is implemented in web infrastructures.
