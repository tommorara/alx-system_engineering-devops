# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Description

This project is part of the curriculum of the DevOps and Shell programming training by Sylvain Kalache. It focuses on the basics of processes and signals in a Linux environment, using Bash and Shell scripting. The project aims to deepen understanding of process management, signal handling, and the use of system calls in scripting.

## Project Details

- **By:** Sylvain Kalache
- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** February 23, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Deadline:** February 24, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** February 23, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review Deadline:** At the project deadline

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, learners should be able to:

- Explain what a PID (Process ID) is.
- Understand what constitutes a process in Linux.
- Identify methods to find a process' PID.
- Demonstrate how to terminate processes using different signals.
- Describe what signals are, including the two signals that cannot be ignored.

## Requirements

- **Environment:** All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Documentation:** A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project directory.
- **Scripting Standards:**
  - All Bash script files must be executable.
  - Scripts should pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors.
  - The first line of all Bash scripts must be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
  - The second line of all Bash scripts should contain a comment explaining the script's purpose.
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs.

## Resources

Participants are encouraged to review the following materials:

- Linux PID
- Linux process
- Linux signal
- Process management in Linux
- Man pages or help sections for: `ps`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `kill`, `exit`, `trap`.

## Additional Information

This project includes an emphasis on originality and the application of knowledge. Copying and pasting solutions is not permitted and may result in removal from the program. Participants are encouraged to strive for understanding and apply what they have learned to achieve the project objectives.
