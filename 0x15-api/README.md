0x15. API
Overview
This project focuses on leveraging Python to interact with an API, retrieve employee data, and export it in different formats. The tasks include gathering data from an API, exporting it to CSV and JSON formats, and organizing it in a comprehensive manner.

Background
Traditional system administrators often relied on Bash scripting, which, while useful, can become inefficient and messy for complex tasks. Modern system administrators, or Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), are akin to software engineers who manage systems and are adept in multiple programming languages, including Python.

APIs are a popular method to expose applications and datasets, allowing external interactions with data. This project involves accessing employee data via an API to organize and export it into various data structures.
