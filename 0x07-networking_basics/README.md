# 0x07. Networking Basics #0

## Description

This project is part of the DevOps and Network training curriculum facilitated by Sylvain Kalache. It aims to introduce participants to the fundamentals of networking, covering key concepts, protocols, and models essential for understanding how networks operate. This project is designed for beginners and assumes no prior knowledge of networking.

## Project Details

- **By**: Sylvain Kalache
- **Weight**: 1
- **Start Date**: February 28, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date**: March 1, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: March 1, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review Deadline**: March 1, 2024, 6:00 AM

## Resources

Participants are encouraged to read or watch the following resources to prepare for the project:

- OSI model
- Different types of networks (LAN, WAN)
- Internet
- MAC address
- IP address (including IPv4 and IPv6)
- Private and public addresses
- Localhost
- TCP and UDP, including TCP/UDP ports List
- Ping / ICMP
- Positional parameters

### Man or Help Pages

- netstat
- ping

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to explain, without external help, the following concepts:

- **OSI Model**
  - What it is
  - Its layers and organization
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**
  - Typical usage and geographical size
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
  - Typical usage and geographical size
- **The Internet**
- **IP Addresses**
  - Types of IP addresses (Private and Public)
  - The purpose of IPv6
- **Localhost**
- **Subnets**
- **TCP/UDP**
  - Main differences
  - Usage and importance of ports
  - Key ports to memorize (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- **Network Diagnostics**
  - Tools and protocols for checking device connectivity

## Project Tasks

This project will include a series of tasks designed to test the participants' understanding of the networking concepts listed above. Details of these tasks will be made available with the project's release. Participants are expected to complete these tasks by the end of the project duration.

## Submission Guidelines

- All tasks must be submitted by the deadline.
- The checker will automatically review submissions.
- Ensure that all submissions adhere to the specified requirements.

## Evaluation

Participants' understanding of networking basics will be assessed based on the accuracy and completeness of their task submissions. Feedback will be provided after the auto review process.

## Conclusion

This project aims to lay a solid foundation in networking basics, equipping participants with the knowledge needed to understand more advanced network concepts and configurations in future projects.
