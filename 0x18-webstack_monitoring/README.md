## Concepts to Explore

For this project, we will explore the following concepts:

- **Monitoring**
- **Server**

## Background Context

“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of data-ism, monitoring the performance of our software systems is crucial. This project focuses on implementing tools to measure what is happening on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be categorized into two main areas:

1. **Application Monitoring:** Collecting data about your running software to ensure it behaves as expected.
2. **Server Monitoring:** Collecting data about your virtual or physical servers to ensure they are not overloaded (this includes monitoring CPU, memory, disk, or network usage).

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, you should read or watch the following materials:

- [What is server monitoring](#)
- [What is application monitoring](#)
- [System monitoring by Google](#)
- [Nginx logging and monitoring](#)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without needing to reference additional materials:

1. **Monitoring:** Understanding the importance and methods of monitoring software systems.
2. **Application Monitoring:** How to gather and interpret data about your running software to ensure optimal performance.
3. **Server Monitoring:** How to monitor the health of your servers, ensuring they are not overloaded and are performing efficiently.

## Project Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up server monitoring for a given web stack.
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement application monitoring tools to gather data on software performance.
- [ ] **Task 3:** Analyze and interpret the monitoring data to identify potential issues.
- [ ] **Task 4:** Generate reports based on the monitoring data for review and action.

## Project Submission

Please ensure all tasks are completed and submitted by **June 7, 2024, 6:00 AM**. An auto review will be conducted at the deadline to assess your performance.

## Conclusion

This project will enhance your understanding of web stack monitoring, equipping you with the skills to measure and improve the performance of both your applications and servers. Happy monitoring!
