## Project: 0x10. Python - Network #0

This project covers various aspects of networking in Python, focusing on HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and related concepts. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of how web communication works and how to interact with web resources programmatically using Python.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- Understanding URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), including their components such as scheme, domain name, sub-domain, port number, and query string.
- Grasping the fundamentals of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), including HTTP requests, HTTP responses, HTTP headers, and HTTP message body.
- Recognizing HTTP request methods and their purposes.
- Familiarity with HTTP response status codes and their meanings.
- Understanding HTTP Cookies and their role in web communication.
- Practicing making HTTP requests using cURL.
- Explaining the process behind typing a URL into a web browser and the resulting application-level interactions.

### Resources

To accomplish the objectives of this project, you may refer to the following resources:

- [HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)
- [HTTP Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
- Additional resources as needed for deeper understanding.

### How to Use

This project consists of tasks that involve understanding networking concepts and implementing Python scripts to interact with web resources. You will work on tasks related to reading and interpreting URLs, making HTTP requests, handling HTTP responses, and more.
