# README.md for Project: x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Overview

This project, "x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing," is designed to deepen your understanding of DevOps and Shell scripting with Bash. Led by Sylvain Kalache, this project emphasizes the practical aspects of using loops, conditionals, and parsing techniques in bash scripting.

### Important Dates

- **Project Start**: February 22, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: February 22, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Deadline**: February 23, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review**: Will be launched at the deadline

### Background Context

In this project, you will apply practical skills to create efficient bash scripts that utilize loops, conditionals, and parsing methods. These scripts are fundamental in automating tasks within a DevOps context.

### Resources

#### Read or Watch

- Loops sample
- Variable assignment and arithmetic
- Comparison operators
- File test operators
- Making your scripts portable

#### Man or Help

- `env`
- `cut`
- `for`
- `while`
- `until`
- `if`

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Create SSH keys
- Explain the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- Utilize `while`, `until`, and `for` loops
- Implement `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case` condition statements
- Use the `cut` command effectively
- Understand and apply file and other comparison operators

### Requirements

#### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- You are not allowed to use `awk`
- Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

### Copyright and Plagiarism

- You must create solutions for the tasks by yourself; copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work will not help you meet the learning objectives.
- Publishing any content of this project is not allowed.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

### More Info on Shellcheck

Shellcheck is a crucial tool for writing proper Bash scripts, offering recommendations on syntax and semantics. It's intended to guide you in considering edge cases you might not have thought of. Shellcheck is your ally in scripting! Ensure all your Bash scripts pass Shellcheck without any errors to achieve full points for the tasks.

#### Installing Shellcheck

While Shellcheck is available on the school's computers, you can also install it on your personal computer. Follow the provided instructions for installation on your own device.
